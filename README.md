# Contributing Guideline

## Branchs
Each card needs to be separated by branchs as Feat, issues as Fix and refactors as Chore

Example of branch names:
- Feat/dm-board-modification
- Fix/player-sheat
- Chore/improve-images-on-board

## Commits
Each commit needs to be separated by `feat` `fix` and `chore` like the branchs, but with spaces

Examples:
- feat: added board for DM
- fix: race condition on DB
- chore: refactor connections
